## Hi there!
I'm Tyler. I'm a chiropractic student planning to join and continue my family's practice. Web development is my hobby. I am currently working on a web-based health record system for chiropractors. I am an avid spaceflight enthusiast and something of a coffee aficionado. 

Oh, and I do magic tricks.✨

I am comfortable with [Vanilla.js](http://vanilla-js.com/) and prefer serverside with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). I use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for routing, [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styles, and [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for html.
