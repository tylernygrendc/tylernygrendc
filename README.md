I'm a chiropractor turned software developer using code to improve medical documentation at a national scale. I believe systems that support physicians are the key to improving outcomes and eliminating errors. Building on an early [background in robotics](https://van-wert-robotics-club.webnode.page/teams/), I'm using core web technologies to create and extend health record and practice management systems.
