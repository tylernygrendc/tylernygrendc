## Hi there!
I'm Tyler. I'm a chiropractic student planning to join and continue my family's practice. Web development is my hobby. I am currently working on a web-based health record system for chiropractors. I am an avid spaceflight enthusiast and something of a coffee aficionado. 

Oh, and I do magic tricks.✨

I am comfortable with...
* JavaScript
* SASS / CSS
* pug / HTML
* Node.js and Express.js
